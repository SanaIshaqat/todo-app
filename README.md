## Description :
## Phase 1 Requirements-Lab31

In Phase 1, we’re going to perform some refactoring of the To Do application as built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.

Style the application using the Blueprint Component API{target:_blank}

Properly modularize the application into separate components

Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components

How many To Do Items to show at once
Whether or not to show completed items

## Phase 2 Requirements-Lab32
In Phase 2, we’re going to extend the functionality of our application by allowing the user to make some decisions on how they would like the application to function. Specifically, we’ll let them make changes to 2 settings.

Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
How many To Do Items to show at once
Whether or not to show completed items
Provide the users with a form where they can change the values for those settings
This should be given in the form of a new component, perhaps linked to from the main navigation
Hint: Use Browser Router to create the page/route/component for this
Save the users choices in Local Storage
Retrieve their preferences from Local Storage and apply them to the application on startup
