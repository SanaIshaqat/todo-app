## Description :
## Phase 1 Requirements-Lab31

Style the application using the Blueprint Component API{target:_blank}

Properly modularize the application into separate components

Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components

How many To Do Items to show at once
Whether or not to show completed items
